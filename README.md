# snake-water-gun-game
Snake Water Gun is a classic game that I created a backend for in C language. It is a two-player game where each player chooses one of three options: snake, water, or gun.

Snake beats water, water beats gun, and gun beats snake. The players compete against each other, and the one with the most points at the end wins.

I designed the backend to include the game's logic and user authentication. The game logic checks the choices made by each player and determines the winner of each round. The backend also includes a user authentication system to ensure that only registered users can play the game.

The game's backend is designed to handle multiple concurrent game sessions and store the results of each game session in a database. The database also tracks user statistics, such as the number of wins, losses, and ties.

The Snake Water Gun game backend designed in C language is optimized for speed and efficiency. It provides a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience for users, with robust security measures to protect user data. Overall, the Snake Water Gun game backend is a fun and engaging game that is sure to provide hours of entertainment.
